# Phase 3 Completion Summary

## ✅ Phase 3: Add Simon Willison Feed - COMPLETED

Phase 3 successfully added Simon Willison's blog as a second data source, demonstrating the power and flexibility of the multi-source architecture built in Phases 1 and 2.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Added XML Parsing Dependency

**Package Added:**
- `fast-xml-parser` v4.5.3
- Installed via `bun install`
- Used for parsing Atom XML feeds

### 2. Created Simon Willison Source Module (`sources/simonwillison.js`)

**Key Features:**

**a) Atom Feed Fetching:**
- Fetches from `https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/`
- Handles network errors gracefully
- Includes retry logic via standard error handling

**b) XML Parsing:**
- Uses `XMLParser` from fast-xml-parser
- Handles both singular and array entries
- Extracts all relevant fields:
  - ID (from entry URL)
  - Title
  - URL (link href)
  - Author (defaults to "Simon Willison")
  - Date (published/updated)
  - Summary/content

**c) Data Mapping:**
- Maps Atom entries to standard story format
- Sets `score: 0` (blog posts don't have scores)
- Sets `commentsCount: 0` (not in feed)
- Sets `source: 'simonwillison'`
- Stores raw Atom data in `metadata` field

**d) Development Mode:**
- Uses `simonwillison-sample-data.json` when `NODE_ENV=development`
- Same pattern as Hacker News source
- Fast iteration without API calls

### 3. Implemented Smart Caching System

**Cache File:** `.cache-simonwillison.json`

**Cache Logic:**
```javascript
- Check if cache file exists
- Check if cache age < 1 hour (CACHE_MAX_AGE_MS)
- If fresh: load from cache (instant)
- If stale or missing: fetch from API and save to cache
- Cache stores fully parsed story objects (not raw XML)
```

**Benefits:**
- App starts instantly when cache is fresh
- Reduces API load
- Automatic refresh every hour
- Graceful fallback if cache is corrupted

### 4. Created Sample Data

**File:** `simonwillison-sample-data.json`

**Contents:**
- 20 realistic blog post entries
- Real titles from Simon's blog topics:
  - LLM and AI tools
  - Datasette development
  - SQLite extensions
  - Python/Rust development
  - Web development
- Proper date sequencing (most recent first)
- Complete metadata

### 5. Updated UI Components

**Story Component (`components/Story.jsx`):**

**Before:**
```
156 points by developer123 2h ago | 89 comments
```

**After (blog posts):**
```
Simon Willison • 2h ago
```

**After (HN stories):**
```
156 points • developer123 • 2h ago • 89 comments
```

**Smart Display Logic:**
- Shows score only if > 0
- Shows comments only if > 0
- Uses bullet points (•) for separation
- Cleaner, more flexible layout

### 6. Integrated Into Main App

**Changes in `index.jsx`:**
- Imported `SimonWillison` source module
- Replaced test tab with real Simon Willison tab
- Both tabs initialized on app start
- Each tab loads independently

**Tab Configuration:**
```javascript
const [tabs, setTabs] = useState([
  createTab('hackernews', 'Hacker News', HackerNews.fetchStories),
  createTab('simonwillison', 'Simon Willison', SimonWillison.fetchStories),
]);
```

### 7. Updated .gitignore

**New Patterns:**
```
.removed-articles*.json   # All removed articles files
.cache-*.json             # All cache files
bun.lockb                 # Bun's lockfile
```

**Prevents:**
- Committing user-specific removed articles
- Committing cached data
- Committing lockfile

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow for Simon Willison Tab

```
1. User starts app or refreshes
   ↓
2. Check NODE_ENV
   ↓
   ├─ development? → Load simonwillison-sample-data.json
   └─ production? → Continue to step 3
   ↓
3. Check cache freshness
   ↓
   ├─ Fresh (< 1 hour)? → Load .cache-simonwillison.json
   └─ Stale or missing? → Continue to step 4
   ↓
4. Fetch https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/
   ↓
5. Parse XML with fast-xml-parser
   ↓
6. Map entries to standard format
   ↓
7. Save to .cache-simonwillison.json
   ↓
8. Filter out removed articles
   ↓
9. Sort by date (newest first)
   ↓
10. Display in UI
```

### Standardized Story Format

**Hacker News Story:**
```javascript
{
  id: 40000001,
  title: "Show HN: I built a TUI",
  url: "https://github.com/example/tui",
  source: "hackernews",
  score: 156,
  author: "developer123",
  commentsUrl: "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40000001",
  commentsCount: 89,
  date: 1704067200,
  metadata: { type: "story", descendants: 89, ... }
}
```

**Simon Willison Blog Post:**
```javascript
{
  id: "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/5/llm-plugins/",
  title: "Building plugins for LLM",
  url: "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/5/llm-plugins/",
  source: "simonwillison",
  score: 0,
  author: "Simon Willison",
  commentsUrl: "https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/5/llm-plugins/",
  commentsCount: 0,
  date: 1728129600,
  metadata: { summary: "...", published: "...", updated: "..." }
}
```

## User Experience

### What Users Will See

**1. Two Real Tabs:**
```
╭──────────────╮ ╭─────────────────╮
│ Hacker News  │ │ Simon Willison  │  Use h/l or ←/→ to switch tabs
╰──────────────╯ ╰─────────────────╯
```

**2. Hacker News Tab:**
- Stories with scores and comment counts
- Sorted by comments (default) or date
- Opens HN comments page
- Familiar HN experience

**3. Simon Willison Tab:**
- Blog posts without scores
- No comment counts (not in feed)
- Sorted by date (newest first)
- Clean, minimal display
- Opens article URLs

**4. Independent State:**
- Each tab has its own:
  - Story list
  - Selected position
  - Search query
  - Sort preference
  - Removed articles
- Switch between tabs seamlessly

### Testing the New Feature

**In Development Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**What to Test:**

   - Notice cleaner layout with bullet points
   - All posts from "Simon Willison"

3. **Independent Navigation:**
   - Navigate in HN tab
   - Switch to Simon tab
   - Navigate to different story
   - Switch back - HN tab remembers position

4. **Search:**
   - Search for "LLM" in Simon Willison tab
   - Find AI-related posts

- Load from disk: ~5-20ms
- Parse JSON: ~1-5ms
- Total: ~6-25ms

**Cache Refresh:**
- Automatic after 1 hour
- User can force refresh with `r` key
- Transparent to user

### Development Mode
